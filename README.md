# JupyterNoteBook 

## Description 

Create a data analysis program to analyze the results of a
race for a fiktive customer
 You will be provided with a dataset and asked to
implement a few tasks
 The dataset includes all 10 lap times for 20 racers

## About 

Read the dataset and analyze it to do the following tasks
 At the end your customer wants images of the plots,
bargraphs and so on, that you created and text files with
the text outputs

## Instructions 

1. Output a list of the racers sorted by their placement
starting with the first one. For the first player include
the race time in the output. For all the others include
the delay. The output could look similar to this:

Name hh:mm:ss
1.) Johnson 01:23:01
2.) Maier -00:00:23
3.) Haindl -00:01:02
…

2. Create a plot and a bargraph of the position sorted
racer times. The name should be visible on the x-axis

3. Create another plot where you overlay the position
sorted racer times with the racer respective best lap
times

4. Calculate the pit stop times
 Look at the data and find a pattern with that you
could identify the lap times where the pit stops
where
 Now think about how you could approximate the pit
stop time… tip: mean value of definit values

5. Find the best technical team based on the pit stop times

6. Create a similar output for these results like you did for
the racer times

7. Analyze the data to answer the following questions:
 Which was the fastest o

8. Plot the average lap times

9. Plot the average lap times compared with the winner
lap times
